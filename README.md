Project created while I was doing my internship as a student of OpenClassrooms.

This was my first full stack project. I created the entire backend, from the SQL database to the Node.JS code, and the frontend using Angular (HTML, CSS and Javascript).

It is a social network for a company where the users can create, modify and delete an account, as well as publish texts, photos and comments. A moderator can delete all users, posts and comments. 

I am happy to share it with all the Github comunity!
